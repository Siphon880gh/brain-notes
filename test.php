Hi [Fname],

I hope this message finds you well!

Over the past few months, we've been hard at work upgrading the user interface of <a href="http://www.videolisting.ai">www.videolisting.ai</a> to make creating video listings from static pictures and text easier and of higher quality.

<strong>You’re Invited!</strong>

<strong>When:</strong> Thursday, September 26th at 7:00 PM  
<strong>Where:</strong> CTRL Collective, [_address_]

Join us at our workspace office where you will:
- Receive exclusive access to our new software
- Learn how simple it is to use
- Try it out in person with hands-on support

<strong>Special Offer:</strong> Enjoy a <strong>FREE one-month trial</strong> of the software, allowing you to create as many videos as you like in exchange for your valuable feedback.

<strong>Highlight Feature:</strong> Experience our “Train Your Voice” AI narration. Record a short narration once, and our software will generate narrations with your voice based on the property descriptions you upload.

I’ll reach out in the next few days to see if you can make it. Food and drinks will be served—just remember to bring your laptop.

Feel free to invite a friend or two who might benefit from this tool!

Looking forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,  
Sterling Williams
