localStorage lets you persist data across multiple visists to the domain address. The key returns null if undefined. If is defined, it always returns a string. A common use is to store JSON string with JSON.stringify and to retrieve the key's JSON into useable data with JSON.parse

- You can clear localStorage with:
```
localStorage.clear();
```


- You can get items with:
```
localStorage.getItem("key");
```

- You can check if the item is defined with
```
let isFound = localStorage.getItem("key")!==null;
```

- Finally, you set item with
```
localStorage.setItem("key", 1);
```

- And you always get a string back:
let retrievedDataIsString = gettype localStorage.getItem("key") === "string"
