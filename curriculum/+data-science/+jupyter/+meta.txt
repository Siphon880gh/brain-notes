Jupyter lets you make notebooks that have markdown text but also incorporates graphs and equations that can run dynamically. You can publish into PDF, etc. The language is based in python. The editing philosophy is combo of VIM and Excel. There's an edit/command mode and you have a vertical stack of cells where you enter either "labels" (really, markdown text) or "formula's" (really, code).

JupyterLab is the next generation of the Jupyter Notebook. It's a different GUI and provides more: It aims at fixing many usability issues of the Notebook, and it greatly expands its scope. JupyterLab offers a general framework for interactive computing and data science in the browser, using Python, Julia, R, or one of many other languages.

But, Jupyter notebook seems easier to use/learn. So make two aliases so you can choose between the favors:

alias jl='jupyter-lab'
alias jn='jupyter notebook'

Learn Jupyter UI
- Each line is a cell. So the cells go vertical.
- You can run all cells aka lines or only the ones you select
- There is edit mode that lets you edit a cell. Then there's command mode where you're not editing but doing things such as running a cell
- A cell can render markdown text (such as large headline), or it can run code producing a calculation or pictures or graphs
- So with all the cells rendered/calculated/executed, the whole composite looks like a notebook for business / scientists, etc
