Dev GraphQL

graphql remember there is a client side and a server side (edited) 
3:22
server side has typeDefs that are like schemas, and the resolvers will take in graphql request from the web browser and connect it to mongoo

client side has all the queries / mutations in queries.js and mutations.js that you can call with useQuery hook at your React functional component. they are the same queries/mutations you can run in graphql playground which only shows up in developer mode at 3001:/graphql (edited)

once you understand that, it's a smoother experience
