Dev Mac: Create App with custom icon

do shell script "open /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Sidecar.prefPane"
```

Go File -> Save., and for File Format, select Application. Go to the application and right click -> Show Packaged Contents.

	Alternately you can `ls` into App.app (For example, if you saved the Application as App)

Inside Contents/ you have in particular Info.plist and Resources/

At Info.plist, you can indicate the file icon. The second value is the filename without file extension, case-sensitive (so it'll point to icon file applet.icns)
```
	<key>CFBundleIconFile</key>
	<string>applet</string>
```


Then at Contents/Resources, you can have the file there. File extension is .icns. You can convert png to .icns at
		https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns

The dimensions must be one of these:
16px × 16px
32px × 32px
128px × 128px
256px × 256px
512px × 512px
1024px × 1024px

The app icon should change. If it doesn't, move it to another folder to force an icon refresh through Finder.
